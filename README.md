AgentMesh manages fleets of AI coding agents working in parallel on your codebase. Each agent gets its own git worktree, its own branch, and its own PR. When CI fails, the agent fixes it. When reviewers leave comments, the agent addresses them. You only get pulled in when human judgment is needed.

## Quick Start

> **Prerequisites:** [Node.js 20.18.3+](https://nodejs.org), [Git 2.25+](https://git-scm.com), [`gh` CLI](https://cli.github.com), and:
>
> - **macOS / Linux:** [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki/Installing) — install via `brew install tmux` or `sudo apt install tmux`.
> - **Windows:** PowerShell 7+ recommended. tmux is **not** required — AgentMesh uses native ConPTY via the `runtime-process` plugin (the default on Windows). Set `AO_SHELL=bash` if you have Git Bash and prefer it.

<details>
<summary>Permission denied? Install from source?</summary>

If `npm install -g` fails with EACCES, prefix with `sudo` or [fix your npm permissions](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally).

To install from source (for contributors):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ComposioHQ/agent-orchestrator.git
cd agent-orchestrator && bash scripts/setup.sh
```

</details>

### Zsh Completion

Generate the completion file from the installed CLI:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.zsh/completions
ao completion zsh > ~/.zsh/completions/_ao
```

Then make sure the directory is on your `fpath` before `compinit` runs:

```zsh
fpath=(~/.zsh/completions $fpath)
autoload -Uz compinit
compinit
```

For Oh My Zsh, install the same generated file into a custom plugin directory and add `ao` to your plugin list:

```bash
mkdir -p "${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/ao"
ao completion zsh > "${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/ao/_ao"
```

If you are contributing from a source checkout, you can also symlink the repo copy at [`completions/_ao`](completions/_ao).

### Start

Point it at any repo — it clones, configures, and launches the dashboard in one command:

```bash
ao start https://github.com/your-org/your-repo
```

Or from inside an existing local repo:

```bash
cd ~/your-project && ao start
```

That's it. The dashboard opens at `http://localhost:3000` and the AgentMesh orchestrator agent starts managing your project.
If you are running this repository locally, see [Quick-start.md](Quick-start.md) for the
repo-specific install, run, and smoke-test steps that were verified on Windows.

### Add more projects

```bash
ao start ~/path/to/another-repo
```

## How It Works

1. **You start** — `ao start` launches the dashboard and an orchestrator agent
2. **Orchestrator spawns workers** — each issue gets its own agent in an isolated git worktree
3. **Agents work autonomously** — they read code, write tests, create PRs
4. **Reactions handle feedback** — CI failures and review comments are automatically routed back to the agent
5. **You review and merge** — you only get pulled in when human judgment is needed

The orchestrator agent uses the [AgentMesh CLI](docs/CLI.md) internally to manage sessions. You don't need to learn or use the CLI — the dashboard and orchestrator handle everything.

**Coordination layer (optional):** enabling `agentmesh:` in your config adds a quality-gated
task workflow on top of the basic flow — a builder agent's work is automatically reviewed by a
QA agent with bounded retries and policy checks. Tasks are managed on a dedicated board at
`http://localhost:3000/agentmesh`. See the [AgentMesh Coordination Layer](SETUP.md#agentmesh-coordination-layer)
section for setup. The shortest smoke test is: create a task on `/agentmesh`, leave the branch
blank to auto-generate one, and click `Start` to move it into `Building`.

## Configuration

`ao start` auto-generates `agent-orchestrator.yaml` with sensible defaults. You can edit it afterwards to customize behavior:

```yaml
# agent-orchestrator.yaml
$schema: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ComposioHQ/agent-orchestrator/main/schema/config.schema.json
# Runtime data is auto-derived under ~/.agent-orchestrator/{hash}-{projectId}/
port: 3000

defaults:
  runtime: tmux # default on macOS / Linux; on Windows the default is `process` (ConPTY)
  agent: claude-code
  workspace: worktree
  notifiers: [desktop]

projects:
  my-app:
    repo: owner/my-app
    path: ~/my-app
    defaultBranch: main
    sessionPrefix: app

reactions:
  ci-failed:
    auto: true
    action: send-to-agent
    retries: 2
  changes-requested:
    auto: true
    action: send-to-agent
    escalateAfter: 30m
  approved-and-green:
    auto: false # flip to true for auto-merge
    action: notify
```

CI fails → agent gets the logs and fixes it. Reviewer requests changes → agent addresses them. PR approved with green CI → you get a notification to merge.

Keep the `$schema` line so editors can autocomplete and validate against [`schema/config.schema.json`](schema/config.schema.json).

See [`agent-orchestrator.yaml.example`](agent-orchestrator.yaml.example) for the full reference, or run `ao config-help` for the complete schema.

## Remote Access

AgentMesh keeps your Mac awake while running, so you can access the dashboard remotely (e.g., via Tailscale from your phone) without the machine going to sleep.

**How it works:** On macOS, AgentMesh automatically holds an idle-sleep prevention assertion using `caffeinate`. When AgentMesh exits, the assertion is released.

```yaml
# agent-orchestrator.yaml
$schema: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ComposioHQ/agent-orchestrator/main/schema/config.schema.json
power:
  preventIdleSleep: true # Default on macOS; no-op on Linux and Windows
```

Set to `false` if you want to allow idle sleep while AgentMesh runs.

**Lid-close limitation:** macOS enforces lid-close sleep at the hardware level — no userspace assertion can override it. If you need remote access while traveling with the lid closed, use [clamshell mode](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102505) (external power + display + input device).

**Linux / Windows:** AgentMesh does not currently hold a wake assertion on these platforms. On Linux, idle-sleep behaviour is governed by your desktop environment / `systemd-logind`; configure that directly. On Windows, set the OS power plan if remote access matters while idle.

## Plugin Architecture

Eight plugin slots — seven swappable (below) plus Lifecycle, which is managed by core and not pluggable.

| Slot      | Default                                | Alternatives                                   |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Runtime   | tmux (macOS/Linux) / process (Windows) | process                                        |
| Agent     | claude-code                            | codex, aider, cursor, opencode, kimicode, grok |
| Workspace | worktree                               | clone                                          |
| Tracker   | github                                 | linear, gitlab                                 |
| SCM       | github                                 | gitlab                                         |
| Notifier  | desktop                                | slack, discord, composio, webhook, openclaw    |
| Terminal  | iterm2                                 | web                                            |

All interfaces defined in [`packages/core/src/types.ts`](packages/core/src/types.ts). A plugin implements one interface and exports a `PluginModule`. That's it.

## Why AgentMesh?

Running one AI agent in a terminal is easy. Running 30 across different issues, branches, and PRs is a coordination problem.

**Without orchestration**, you manually: create branches, start agents, check if they're stuck, read CI failures, forward review comments, track which PRs are ready to merge, clean up when done.

**With AgentMesh**, you: `ao start` and walk away. The system handles isolation, feedback routing, and status tracking. You review PRs and make decisions — the rest is automated.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install && pnpm build    # Install and build all packages
pnpm test                      # Run tests (3,288 test cases)
pnpm dev                       # Start web dashboard dev server
```

See [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for code conventions and architecture details.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome. The plugin system makes it straightforward to add support for new agents, runtimes, trackers, and notification channels. Every plugin is an implementation of a TypeScript interface — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [Development Guide](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for the pattern.

## Privacy

AgentMesh does not collect telemetry or analytics. All data stays on your machine:
- Session metadata is stored in `~/.agent-orchestrator/`
- GitHub credentials are used only for GitHub API calls on your behalf
- No usage data, crash reports, or code content leaves your machine
